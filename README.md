# Custom FirstRooms
Mod includes:
- TG
- FTG
- Helpless Unknown
- Karneval Der Toten
- Double Side
- Haunted Hallways
- Undead House
- HQ
- Cube of the Dead
- Depot
- Mob of the deep
- Hazar Zone

**Note:** Swanky and 5and5 decided to use the same map name "zombie_depot" for Karneval Der Toten and Depot respectively.
This makes them unplayable without manually changing them. To change them follow this guide:
- Go to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops\mods\Custom FirstRooms**
zombie_depot2 & zombie_depot2_patch are 5and5's depot.
zombie_depot & zombie_depot_patch are Swanky's Karneval Der Toten.
- Swap the name of the map you want to play to zombie_depot & zombie_depot_patch respectively.
- Now you can either restart the game or reload the mod, both will work

# Things I want to add: 
Add custom first room mod by 5and5 into the mod
